### Assignments
- Create a list of 1000 random integers, filter items < 100, double them then sort asc, take the first 4 numbers
- Create a callable task that return a string, print the result from the main thread
- Create two mock apis that return strings or throw an error. Use completable future to create a joined string from the two results in the order of string 1 + string 2. In the case of exception, return an empty string for each task. Use `exceptionally`

```java
    public static String mockApi1() throws Exception {
        int sleepTime = random.nextInt(5) + 1; // 1 to 5 seconds
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(sleepTime);
        if (random.nextBoolean()) { // 50% chance to throw an exception
            throw new Exception("Mock API 1 failed");
        }
        return "String1";
    }

    public static String mockApi2() throws Exception {
        int sleepTime = random.nextInt(5) + 1; // 1 to 5 seconds
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(sleepTime);
        if (random.nextBoolean()) { // 50% chance to throw an exception
            throw new Exception("Mock API 2 failed");
        }
